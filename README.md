# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- This project is the creation of a rudimentary webpage that serves as place for me (a boot camp student) to store and access some notes on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript (JS), as well as providing the opportunity to put the aforementioned things into practice.
- Doing so, I learnt some very early fundamentals to coding in HTML, CSS and JS, as well as being introduced to git-flow and GitHub, and how to create a README for this and future projects.
